VMWARE:

Installation
Install open-vm-tools. If the legacy vmhgfs shared folder module is desired, the open-vm-tools-dkmsAUR[broken link: package not found] package must be installed (the new vmhgfs-fuse driver is included in open-vm-tools). Start and/or enable vmtoolsd.service and vmware-vmblock-fuse.service.

Try to install gtkmm3 manually if it does not work properly. To enable copy and paste between host and guest gtkmm3 is required.


Additionally, to auto start vmware-tools on boot, create a new file /etc/systemd/system/vmwaretools.service:

/etc/systemd/system/vmwaretools.service
[Unit]
Description=VMWare Tools daemon

[Service]
ExecStart=/etc/init.d/vmware-tools start
ExecStop=/etc/init.d/vmware-tools stop
PIDFile=/var/lock/subsys/vmware
TimeoutSec=0
RemainAfterExit=yes
 
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
And enable the new systemd service:

 # systemctl enable vmwaretools.service
